### Mission Statement: 
To close the digital divide for accessible technology.

### Problem Statement: 
During this novel time of pandemic, people are becoming increasingly reliant on technology to stay connected with others. However, the high cost of electronic devices makes them inaccessible to many lower income minority groups. In an increasingly electronic world, this further puts individuals in these groups at a disadvantage when it comes to medical health, educational, and occupational opportunities, since they donâ€™t have access to necessary electronic devices to get them connected. Existing solutions are largely online and donate directly to low income individuals, but are inaccessible to the population they are trying to help since these people may not have access to the internet or to devices to apply for help. Moreover, donors are unable to donate directly to organizations that can help. How can we connect device donors to organizations (schools, clinics, etc) so that we can help low income individuals achieve access to technology?
