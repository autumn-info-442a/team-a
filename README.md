### HowToo Strategy Feedback: 
Besides the steps, it would have been beneficial to have video instructions too. if not that, maybe some visuals for reference. Introductions for editing the repository should have been provided

### Problem Statement: 

How can we connect device donors to organizations (schools, clinics, etc) so that we can help low income individuals achieve access to technology?

The high cost of electronic devices makes them inaccessible to many lower income minority groups. In an increasingly electronic world, this further puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to medical health, educational, and occupational opportunities, since they donâ€™t have access to necessary electronic devices. Accessitech strives to make electronic devices and other technology accessible by making it easy to connect device donors directly to organizations that have mission statements that align with their values. Existing solutions are largely online and donate directly to low income individuals, but are inaccessible to the population they are trying to help since these people may not have access to the internet or to devices to apply.
