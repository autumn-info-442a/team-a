## Problem

The high cost of electronic devices makes them inaccessible to many lower income minority groups. The Stanford computer science department recognizes and defines this digital divide as “the growing gap between the underprivileged members of society… who do not have access to computers or the internet; and the wealthy, middle-class, and young Americans living in urban and suburban areas who have access” (Digital Divide). In an increasingly electronic world, this further puts individuals in these groups at a disadvantage when it comes to medical health, educational, and occupational opportunities, since they don’t have access to necessary electronic devices. Existing solutions are largely online and donate directly to low income individuals, but are inaccessible to the population they are trying to help since these people may not have access to the internet or to devices to apply. Moreover, donors cannot donate directly to organizations. How can we connect device donors to organizations (schools, clinics, etc) so that we can help low income individuals achieve access to technology?

## Solution
Accessitech aims to develop a solution by acting as a bridge between technology device seekers and donors. We strive to make electronic devices and other technology accessible by making it easy to connect device donors directly to organizations that have mission statements that align with their values. Through this method, we hope to help people in need get access to technology.


### Landing page:
On the landing page, the user is greeted with the goal of Accesitech - we want to help them find an organization they can donate their devices to or help their organization meet their device donation goals. They then have two interaction choices where they can choose to donate their device or submit their organization to set up a device donation goal for their organization. When the user clicks “Donate”, they will be moved to a page where they can view different organizations to help them make an informed decision about what organizations they want to donate to. On the other hand, when the user clicks on “Submit an organization”, they will be redirected to a form on the site where they will fill out information about their organization and devices that they need. This page allows the user to easily determine which part of the site they need to navigate to.
Organizations page:

To start off, when a donor clicks on “donate” on the landing page they will be led to the organizations page where they will be able to find an organization that they want to donate to based on their values. They can search for an organization by it’s name directly, or use the drop down menus. When they click on the “Type” drop down menu, they will have the option to filter between health, education, occupation, military, and other types of organizations. In addition, the donor can further filter their results by using the “Sort by” drop down menu which has options of default, high to low donation progress reached, low to high donation progress reached, and by date posted. After these “Type” and “Sort by” choices are made, the page will update with the filters the donor has chosen to help them easily narrow down and identify organizations that align with their values and help them make informed decisions about who they may want to donate to. When the donor clicks on “Learn more” they will be directed to the individual organization’s page to allow them to do more research on the organization to see if they are a good fit for them. Then when they click “Donate” they will be led to a form where they can fill out the devices they are wanting to donate.


### Individual organization page:
Once a donor selects the “Learn more” button for a specific organization, they are taken to that individual organization’s page. On this page is the organization name, devices needed, and mission statement on the right hand side of the page, as well as the logo image and contact information (phone, email, address) on the left hand side of the page. These resources allow the donor to reach out to an organization if they have more questions. Below the contact information is a progress bar that shows how many devices out of the organization’s donation goal have been received, as well as a “Donate” button. When the donor clicks on “Donate” they will be directed to a form that they fill out with devices they are willing to donate.


### Device donation page:
On the device donation page, the donor can see on the top of the page where they have decided to make a donation to. The donor must fill in the required information like first and last name, phone number, and the address. If any of these are missing when the donor tries to confirm their donation, there will be a message above the “Confirm donation” button that says to please fill out the respective information (first and last name, phone number, and/or address) that is missing. This page also asks for the confirmation for the device type and the quantity of that particular device that the donor wants to give in. In the beginning, the “Donation Summary” will have no device or quantities added. When the donor clicks on “Add device”, the “Donation Summary” will update with the device(s) they have chosen to donate. They also have the option to remove a device from the “Donation Summary” if they make a mistake or do not want to donate the device anymore. By clicking “Remove” the “Donation Summary” will update by removing the device from the list. In order to continue, the donor has to check mark all the three requirements which can be seen in the wireframe. If these requirements are not met, they will receive a message above the “Confirm donation” button saying that they cannot confirm their donation unless all three requirements are met. On the right hand side, the donor can see the summary of the device they want to donate and also the number of devices they are donating. Additionally, if the donor tries to confirm their donation without any devices added, a message “Please add devices to donate” will appear above the “Confirm donation” instead. Once everything looks good and all the conditions are met, the donor clicks “Confirm donation” which will lead them to a confirmation page thanking them for their donation.


### Device confirmation page:
After clicking “Confirm donation” on the previous page, the website will now take the user to the device confirmation page. This page thanks the donor for their donation and also provides a full summary of the type and number of devices they want to donate. They will also be able to see a shipping label that they would need to attach on top of the box when they ship their items. This page also allows the donor to cancel their donation for whatever reasons they might have and show a message saying “Donation has been successfully canceled” below the shipping label and the “Cancel donation” button will disappear.


### Submit an organization page:
As an organization, they can select the “Submit an organization” button from either the landing page or in the navigation bar at the top of the page to be taken to a page for submitting an organization. On this page, the organization can fill out the name and type of the organization they are, their contact information (location, phone, email), needed devices, donation goal, and mission statement. At the end of the form, the organization can then select the “Submit organization goal” at the bottom of the page and be redirected to the organizations page where a new listing will appear for that organization and its device needs. However, if any of the contact information is missing, there will be a message above the “Submit organization goal” saying to please fill out the respective information (location, phone, and/or email) that is missing before they can submit their organization goal.
